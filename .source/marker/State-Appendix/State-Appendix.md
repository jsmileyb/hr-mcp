# <span id="page-2-0"></span>State Supplements

Effective Date: 01/01/2025

#### **Interaction with the Handbook**

Gresham Smith's workforce is spread across several states, and state laws differ in many respects. The State Supplements contained in the Employee Handbook are meant to supplement the handbook by providing additional information regarding state-specific requirements, if any, for various policies. As with the Employee Handbook, the contents of the State Supplements are guidelines only, and do not create an employment contract. Employment with Gresham Smith is at-will and may be terminated at any time with or without cause or notice by either the employee or the firm.

Generally, employees may be eligible to receive the benefits under Gresham Smith's core policies in the handbook or the policies in these State Supplements, whichever provides greater benefits to employees. In other words, the policies in the State Supplements do not supplement Gresham Smith's core Employee Handbook policies where those core policies provide greater benefits.

You can view our general Equal Employment Opportunity policy on page 9 of the Employee Handbook.

If you have any questions about policy content or which policies apply to you, please contact Human Resources.

## <span id="page-3-0"></span>State Supplement: Alabama

Effective Date: 11/15/2022

#### **Weapons in the Workplace**

Pursuant to Alabama Act 2013-283, an Alabama employee may store lawfully possessed firearms in the employee's privately owned vehicle, while the vehicle is in Gresham Smith designated parking areas, if and only if all of the following requirements are satisfied:

- The employee's vehicle is operated or parked where it is permitted to be; and
- The firearm is either:
	- o Kept inside the vehicle and out of sight, while the employee is attending the vehicle; or
	- o Kept out of sight, locked in a compartment, container, or in the interior of the vehicle or in a compartment or container securely affixed to the vehicle, when the vehicle is unattended; and
- The employee has a valid Concealed Weapons Permit; or
- If the employee does not have a valid Concealed Weapons Permit, they may have in their vehicle a firearm that is not a pistol and is legal for hunting in Alabama if:
	- o The employee has a valid Alabama hunting license; and
	- o The firearm is unloaded at all times; and
	- o It is during a season in which hunting is permitted by Alabama law; and
	- o The employee has not been convicted of any crime of violence, nor is subject to a Domestic Violence Order, as those terms are defined by law; and

	- o The employee has not been committed to a psychiatric hospital or similar treatment facility for inpatient or outpatient treatment.

If an employee does not meet requirements of both #1 and #2 bullet points (above) and one of either #3 or #4 bullet points (above), they are prohibited from having a firearm in a vehicle on Gresham Smith property.

If it is found that an employee is not in compliance with the law and Gresham Smith policy, the employee may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

## **Attendance and Time Off: Voting**

For employees in Alabama, if a period of time beyond 30 minutes to vote is necessary, those employees are entitled to an additional 30 minutes of paid absence in order to vote in a general or special election if the polls:

- Open less than two (2) hours before your regular work shift, or
- Close less than one hour (1) hour after the end of your regular work shift.

You must request voting absence prior to Election Day. Your supervisor may specify the time of day when you may be absent.

If you are appointed as a precinct election officer under Section 17-8-1 of the Alabama Code, you will be excused from employment without penalty of loss of time for Election Day to perform the duties to which you have been appointed. This leave time will be uncompensated. You must provide proper documentation of the appointment and the dates of the required service to your immediate supervisor at least seven days before the leave is required.

For more information, view the Voting policy in the handbook.

#### **Military Leave**

 

Alabama employees who are members of state or federal military services (including National and State Guard) shall be entitled to military leave of absence for defense, training, or other service. Employees utilizing this leave will not lose pay, time, efficiency rating, annual vacation, or sick leave. Nonetheless, employees will not be paid more than 168 working hours per calendar year or 168 working hours at any one service. Employees must submit duty papers to their immediate supervisor as early as practicable to facilitate this leave.

#### **Crime Victim Leave**

Gresham Smith does not discriminate against any employee in Alabama who is the victim of a crime. If you or your spouse, sibling, parent, or child/ward are the victim of a crime, you will be permitted time off work to:

- Respond to a subpoena to testify in criminal proceedings; or
- Participate in reasonable preparations for these proceedings.

You must notify the firm immediately when you are called for a court appearance as a victim of a crime, and you must provide a copy of the summons to your supervisor. Gresham Smith will maintain records of your leave in a confidential manner.

As with other personal court appearances, you will not be paid. You can use your accrued, unused PTO. You will retain all seniority rights and other standing.

For more information, view the Jury Duty/Other Court Appearances policy in the handbook.

#### **Volunteer Fire or Emergency Medical Member Leave**

Gresham Smith will allow eligible Alabama employees to take leave to respond to an emergency call before they are due to report to work. This leave is unpaid. You can use your accrued, unused PTO. You will retain all seniority rights and other standing, and you will not be retaliated against for taking emergency response leave as permitted.

"Emergency" means going to, attending to, or coming from a fire call, a hazardous or toxic materials spill and cleanup, any other situation to which a volunteer fire department is dispatched, or a medical emergency to prevent the imminent loss of life.

Before taking emergency response leave, employees must try to contact their immediate supervisor to give notice that they have been dispatched to an emergency.

Gresham Smith may require employees who take emergency response leave to provide a statement regarding their response to an emergency call and the time of the call. Employees who are volunteer firefighters must obtain this statement from the chief of their volunteer fire department. Employees who are members of an emergency medical service must obtain the statement from their fire department or emergency medical service.

## <span id="page-6-0"></span>State Supplement: Arizona

Effective Date: 11/15/2022

#### **Attendance and Time Off: Voting**

For employees in Arizona, if a period of time beyond 30 minutes to vote is necessary, those employees are entitled to an additional reasonable paid absence in order to vote in a general or special election if the polls:

- Open less than three (3) hours before your regular work shift, or
- Close less than three (3) hours after the end of your regular work shift.

You must request voting absence prior to Election Day. Your supervisor may specify the time of day when you may be absent.

For more information, view the Voting policy in the handbook.

#### **National Guard or Armed Forces Reserves Leave**

All employees in Arizona who are members of the National Guard of any state or the U.S. Armed Forces Reserves are eligible for leave to comply with orders for active duty or to attend camps, maneuvers, formations, or armory drills. As with other leaves of absence, you will not be paid. You can use your accrued, unused PTO.

Upon your return, you will be reinstated to your same position or a higher position commensurate with your ability, experience, and seniority, or rank. National Guard or Armed Forces Reserves Leave will not affect your accrued, unused PTO, but you will not accrue new PTO hours while on leave.

#### **Paid Sick Leave**

In accordance with Arizona's Fair Wages and Healthy Families Act, all Arizona employees are eligible to accrue paid sick time at a rate of one hour of earned sick time for every 30 hours worked. For employees who work in Arizona who are eligible for sick leave under the general paid PTO policy and/or any other applicable sick time/leave law or ordinance, this policy applies solely to the extent it provides greater benefits/rights on any specific issue or issues than the general paid sick days policy and/or any other applicable sick time/leave law or ordinance. Paid sick time is capped at 24 hours per year.

Paid sick time can be used for the following reasons:

- To care for your mental or physical illness, injury or health condition, need for medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury or health condition; or for their preventative care.
- To care for a family member's mental or physical illness, injury or health condition, need for medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury or health condition; or for their preventative care.
- When you or your family member needs treatment or counseling because they are victims of domestic violence, abuse, sexual violence, or stalking.
- When businesses or schools are closed because of a public health emergency.
- When care is required for you or a family member who has been exposed to a communicable disease.

"Family member" includes spouses, registered domestic partners, children (regardless of age, including biological, adopted or foster child, stepchild or legal ward, a child of a domestic partner, child to whom the employee stands in loco parentis, or an individual to whom the employee stood in loco parentis when the individual was a minor), parents (including stepparents, foster parents, adopted parents, legal guardians, and parents-in-law), grandparents, siblings, or any other individual whose relationship with the employee is equal to a familial relationship.

Paid sick leave accruals will be tracked on all employees' paystubs. Paid sick leave benefits will begin accruing on your hire date. You can request use of paid sick time after 90 days of employment.

Unused paid sick time benefits will carry over from one calendar year to the next (January 1 through December 31). Paid sick leave taken that exceeds the amount of any paid sick time accrual will not be paid. Paid sick time must be taken in at least 1/4-hour increments.

Whenever possible, paid sick time should be scheduled in advance. When the need for paid sick leave is foreseeable, the employee must make a good faith effort to request the time off in advance and must make every effort to schedule the time off in a manner that does not unduly disrupt Gresham Smith's business.

If the need for paid sick leave is not foreseeable, the employee must contact their supervisor as soon as possible, which, absent exigent circumstances, generally means within hours of when the need for leave arose, but in any event, prior to the start of an employee's shift.

If you take earned paid sick time for three or more consecutive workdays, your supervisor may request reasonable documentation to verify that this leave was used for a permitted reason. Paid sick leave will not count as hours worked toward the calculation of overtime pay. Accrued but unused paid sick leave, no matter the amount, will not be paid out at the conclusion of employment.

Gresham Smith prohibits employees from being retaliated or discriminated against for exercising their rights to paid sick leave.

#### **Smoking/Tobacco/e-Cigarettes**

In compliance with the Smoke-Free Arizona Act, Gresham Smith prohibits smoking within 20 feet of any company property's entrances, open windows, or ventilation systems.

## <span id="page-8-0"></span>State Supplement: California

Effective Date: 01/01/2024

#### **Witness and Crime Victim Leave**

California employees who are victims of qualifying acts of violence (including domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, threats of or acts causing bodily injury or death, or brandishing a firearm or other dangerous weapon) will be permitted to take leave to attend judicial proceedings related to the crime. Employees may also take leave to attend proceedings involving an immediate family member, a registered domestic partner, or a child of a registered domestic partner who is the victim of a felony. "Immediate family member" includes a spouse, children, stepchildren, sisters, brothers, stepsisters, stepbrothers, parents, and stepparents.

This policy also applies to California employees who have an obligation to participate in a judicial proceeding as a witness.

As with other personal court appearances, you will not be paid. You can use your accrued, unused PTO. You will retain all seniority rights and other standing.

For more information, view the Jury Duty/Other Court Appearances policy in the handbook.

#### **Paid Sick Leave**

Under California law, all employees who complete 30 days of employment in California are eligible to accrue paid sick leave starting with their first day of employment. For employees who work in California who are eligible for sick leave under the general paid PTO policy and/or any other applicable sick time/leave law or ordinance, this policy applies solely to the extent it provides greater benefits/rights on any specific issue or issues than the general paid sick days policy and/or any other applicable sick time/leave law or ordinance.

Employees accrue paid sick leave at the rate of one hour for every 30 hours of work, up to the maximum of at least 80 hours or ten days, whichever is greater, per 12-month period. The 12-month period begins each year on January 1 and ends on December 31. Exempt employees are treated as working 40 hours per workweek, unless their usual workweek is less than 40 hours in which case they would accrue paid sick leave based on the number of hours worked in their usual workweek. Employees may use up to 40 hours or five days (whichever is greater) of paid sick leave per year per 12-month period.

Paid sick leave may be used for the following reasons:

- For diagnosis, care or treatment of an existing health condition of or preventive care for, the employee or employee's family member (meaning a child, including biological, adopted or foster child, stepchild, legal ward or a child to whom the employee stands in loco parentis, all regardless of age or dependency status); spouse; registered domestic partner; designated person (a person identified by the employee at the time the employee requests paid sick days) parent (including biological, adoptive or foster parent, stepparent or legal guardian of the employee or employee's spouse or registered domestic partner or a person who stood in loco parentis when the employee was a minor child); grandparent; grandchild; or a sibling; or
- For the employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking:
	- o To obtain or attempt to obtain a temporary restraining order, restraining order or other injunctive relief;
	- o To help ensure the health, safety or welfare of the victim or the victim's child;
	- o To seek medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking;
	- o To obtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program or rape crisis center as a result of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking;
	- o To obtain psychological counseling related to an experience of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking; or
	- o To participate in safety planning and take other actions to increase safety from future domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, including temporary or permanent relocation.

Unless advised otherwise, Gresham Smith will assume, subject to applicable law, that employees want to use available paid sick leave for reasons set forth above. Employees will be paid for such absences to the extent they have paid sick leave available.

Paid sick leave may be requested orally, in writing, electronically or by any other means acceptable to Gresham Smith. When possible, employees should include the expected duration of the absence. If the need is foreseeable employees must provide reasonable advance notice to their immediate supervisor of the need to use accrued paid sick leave, and also make a reasonable effort to schedule the paid sick leave in a manner that does not unduly disrupt operations. Where the need is not foreseeable, employees should provide notice as early as practicable.

Unused accrued sick leave will carry over from one year to the next up to a maximum of 40 hours or five days, whichever is greater. However, the total amount of paid sick leave that can be accrued at any time is 80 hours or ten days, whichever is greater. Accrued but unused paid sick leave under this policy will not be paid at separation.

Gresham Smith prohibits employees from being retaliated or discriminated against for exercising their rights to paid sick leave.

#### **Attendance and Time Off: Voting**

For employees in California, if a period of time beyond 30 minutes to vote is necessary, those employees are entitled to an additional 1.5 hours of paid leave in order to vote in a general or special election.

An employee's request for time off to vote may be denied if the polls are open for more than two consecutive hours before or after his/her scheduled work hours on Election Day.

You must request voting absence at least three days prior to Election Day. Your supervisor may specify the time of day when you may be absent.

For more information, view the Voting policy in the handbook.

#### **Bereavement Leave**

California employees who have been employed for at least 30 days may take unpaid bereavement leave of up to five (5) days upon the death of a family member.

For purposes of this policy, "family member" includes a spouse or a child, parent, sibling, grandparent, grandchild, domestic partner, or parent-in-law. Bereavement leave need not be consecutive but must be completed within three (3) months of the family member's death.

If you wish to take bereavement leave, please contact Human Resources.

#### **Reproductive Loss Leave**

California employees who have been employed for at least 30 days may take unpaid leave of up to five (5) days following a reproductive loss event.

For purposes of this policy, a "reproductive loss event" is defined as the day of (or, for a multiple-day event, the final day of) a failed adoption, failed surrogacy, miscarriage, stillbirth, or an unsuccessful assisted reproduction. Leave taken under this policy is limited to a maximum of 20 days within a 12-month period.

If you wish to take reproductive loss leave, please contact Human Resources.

#### **Workplace Reasonable Accommodation of Religion**

Pursuant to the California Workplace Religious Freedom Act ("WRFA"), unless the accommodation imposes an undue hardship on it, Gresham Smith will provide religious accommodations to California employees' for sincerely held religious beliefs including:

- Observances of a Sabbath or other religious holy days.
- Reasonable time necessary for travel before and after a religious observance.
- Religious dress and grooming practices, including the wearing of religious clothing, head or face coverings, any other item that is part of an individual observing a religion or religious creed.

To request a religious accommodation, please contact Human Resources.

#### **Nursing Mothers Leave**

Any employee who is a nursing mother is eligible to take a reasonable amount of break time to express breast milk for the employee's infant child each time the employee has a need to express breast milk. There is no length of service requirement to be eligible.

To request lactation accommodation, please contact Human Resources.

#### **State Disability Insurance**

The State of California offers a disability insurance program designed to partially replace wages lost due to a non-work-related illness, disability, injury, or pregnancy. Disability insurance is funded by employees' contributions. Subject to eligibility requirements, disability insurance is available to California employees unable to work for eight or more consecutive calendar days. For information or to apply for coverage, please contact Human Resources.

#### **Volunteer Firefighters' Leave**

Eligible California employees will be granted unpaid time off to serve as volunteer firefighters, reserve peace officers, or emergency rescue personnel. Employees may substitute PTO for any unpaid portion of leave to perform such emergency duties or training.

If you wish to take leave under this policy, please contact Human Resources.

## **Compensation and Performance: Compensation**

It is Gresham Smith's policy and practice to accurately compensate California employees and to do so in compliance with all applicable state and federal laws. To ensure employees are paid properly and no improper deductions are made, employees must review their pay stubs promptly to identify and to report all errors.

If the employee believes a mistake has occurred or if the employee has any questions, the employee should contact Human Resources.

#### **Paid Family Leave**

Under California state law, Gresham Smith is required to deduct a certain amount from employee pay to fund California's Paid Family Leave (PFL) program, which is administered by the California Employment Development Department (EDD). PFL is not a "leave" program, and it does not provide employees with leave beyond what is provided in Gresham Smith's policies. Instead, PFL is a disability benefits program that provides eligible employees with compensation for lost wages, for up to eight weeks in a 12-month period when employees need to take time off work to care for a seriously ill spouse, domestic partner, designated person (any individual related by blood or whose association with the employee is equivalent to a family relationship), child, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild or sibling, or to bond with a new child. Benefits are also available to participate in a qualifying event resulting from a spouse, registered domestic partner, parent, or child's military deployment to a foreign country.

If you wish to take leave under this policy, please contact Human Resources.

## **Employment Practices: Pre-employment Screening**

Gresham Smith will not exclude a California applicant from an initial interview solely because of a past arrest, criminal conviction, or participation in a diversion program by requiring an applicant to disclose such information:

- On an employment application;
- Before an interview; or
- If no interview is conducted before a conditional offer of employment.

However, Gresham Smith may, before extending an offer to an applicant, inquire into the applicant's criminal background.

For more information, view the Pre-employment Screening Policy in the handbook.

## <span id="page-12-0"></span>State Supplement: Colorado

Effective Date: 06/23/2025 – Supersedes Date: 1/1/2024

#### **Accommodating the Disabled**

In compliance with Colorado law, Gresham Smith will not discriminate against Colorado employees because of pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions. In addition to accommodating individuals with a disability as defined in the handbook, if employees request reasonable accommodation due to health conditions related to pregnancy or the physical recovery from childbirth, we will endeavor to provide a reasonable accommodation to enable applicants and employees to perform the essential functions of the job, unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business. Gresham Smith will engage in a timely, good faith, and interactive process with the employee to determine effective, reasonable accommodations for conditions related to pregnancy, physical recovery from childbirth, or a related condition.

Reasonable accommodations may include, but are not limited to: more frequent or longer break periods; more frequent restroom, food and water breaks; acquisition or modification of equipment or seating; limitations on lifting; temporary transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position if available, with return to the current position after pregnancy; job restructuring; light duty, if available; assistance with manual labor; or modified work schedules.

Gresham Smith will not require employees affected by pregnancy, physical recovery from childbirth, or a related condition to accept an accommodation that they choose not to accept if they did not request an accommodation or if the accommodation is not necessary for the employee to perform the essential functions of the job, nor will we require a pregnant employee to take leave if another reasonable accommodation is available which will permit the employee to continue working.

Gresham Smith reserves the right to require employees to provide a note stating the necessity of a reasonable accommodation from a licensed healthcare provider before providing a reasonable accommodation.

Gresham Smith will not take adverse action against pregnant employees who request or use a reasonable accommodation related to pregnancy, physical recovery from childbirth, or a related condition. Gresham Smith will not deny employment opportunities to employees based on the need to make a reasonable accommodation related to pregnancy, physical recovery from childbirth or a related condition.

Gresham Smith will provide the following to nursing mothers:

- Reasonable break time to allow an employee to express breast milk for their nursing child up to two years after the child's birth.
- A private location in close proximity to the work area (other than a toilet stall) where an employee can express breast milk.

If you would like to request a reasonable accommodation, please contact your immediate supervisor or Human Resources.

#### **Employment Practices: Pre-employment Screening**

The Colorado Chance to Compete Act is intended to provide people with criminal records with a more meaningful chance to compete for a job in the workforce and grow Colorado's economy, while protecting an employer's ability to make whatever hiring decision the employer deems appropriate. Gresham Smith will not inquire into a Colorado applicant's criminal history during the initial application and/or interview process. However, Gresham Smith may, before extending an offer to an applicant, inquire into the applicant's criminal history.

#### **Paid Sick Leave**

Gresham Smith provides paid sick leave to all Colorado employees. For employees who work in Colorado who are eligible for sick leave under the general paid PTO policy and/or any other applicable sick time/leave law or ordinance, this policy applies solely to the extent it provides greater benefits/rights on any specific issue or issues than the general paid sick days policy and/or any other applicable sick time/leave law or ordinance.

Exempt employees are assumed to work 40 hours in each workweek unless their normal workweek is less than 40 hours, in which case paid sick leave accrues based on that normal workweek.

For purposes of this policy, the year is the consecutive 12-month period beginning January 1 and ending on December 31.

Employees may begin using accrued paid sick leave immediately. Paid sick leave may be used in hourly increments. Employees may not use more than 48 hours of accrued paid sick leave in any year.

Employees may use accrued paid sick leave for the following reasons:

- For mental or physical illness, injury or health condition that prevents the employee from working; the need to obtain a medical diagnosis, care or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury or health condition; or the need to obtain preventive medical care;
- To care for a family member who has a mental or physical illness, injury or health condition; needs to obtain a medical diagnosis, care or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury or health condition; or needs to obtain preventive medical care;
- When the employee or a family member has been the victim of domestic abuse, sexual assault or harassment and the use of leave is to:
	- o Seek medical attention to recover from a mental or physical illness, injury or health condition caused by the domestic abuse, sexual assault or harassment;
	- o Obtain services from a victim services organization;
	- o Obtain mental health or other counseling;
	- o Seek relocation due to the domestic abuse, sexual assault or harassment; or
	- o Seek legal services, including preparation for or participation in a civil or criminal proceeding relating to or resulting from the domestic abuse, sexual assault or harassment;
- When, due to a public health emergency, a public official has ordered closure of the employee's place of business or the school or place of care of the employee's child and the employee needs to be absent from work to care for the child;
- When, due to inclement weather, power/heat/water loss, or other unexpected event, the employee must evacuate their residence or care for a family member whose school or place of care is closed; and

- For bereavement or financial/legal needs after a death of a family member.
For purposes of this policy, "family member" means a person who is related to the employee by blood, marriage, civil union or adoption; a child to whom the employee stands in loco parentis or a person who stood in loco parentis when the employee was a minor; or a person for whom the employee is responsible for providing or arranging health- or safety-related care.

Use of paid sick leave will not be conditioned upon the employee searching for or finding a replacement worker.

Unless advised otherwise, Gresham Smith will assume, subject to applicable law, that employees want to use available paid sick leave for reasons set forth above. Employees will be paid for such absences to the extent they have paid sick leave available.

Paid sick leave may be requested orally, in writing, electronically or by any other means acceptable to Gresham Smith. When possible, employees should include the expected duration of the absence. If the need is foreseeable employees must provide reasonable advance notice to their immediate supervisor of the need to use accrued paid sick leave, and also make a reasonable effort to schedule the paid sick leave in a manner that does not unduly disrupt operations. Where the need is not foreseeable, employees should provide notice as early as practicable.

For paid sick leave of four (4) or more consecutive workdays, Gresham Smith may require reasonable documentation that the paid sick leave was used for an authorized purpose. Gresham Smith will not require the disclosure of details relating to domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking, or the details of the employee's or family member's health information as a condition of providing paid sick leave.

Paid sick leave will be paid at the same hourly rate or salary and with the same benefits, including healthcare benefits, as the employee normally earns during hours worked. Use of paid sick leave is not considered hours worked for purposes of calculating overtime.

Employees may carry over up to 48 hours of accrued, unused paid sick leave to the following calendar year. Accrued but unused paid sick leave will not be paid at separation.

In addition to accrued paid sick leave explained above, on the date a public health emergency is declared, Gresham Smith will supplement each employee's accrued paid sick leave as necessary to ensure that the employee may take paid sick leave as follows:

- Employees who normally work 40 or more hours in a week may take at least 80 hours of paid sick leave in a public health emergency;
- Employees who normally work fewer than 40 hours in a week may take at least the greater of either the amount of time the employee is scheduled to work in a 14-day period or the amount of time the employee actually works on average in a 14-day period.

Gresham Smith may count unused accrued paid sick leave, as explained above, toward the supplemental paid sick leave required for a public health emergency. Employees may use public health emergency paid sick leave until four (4) weeks after the official termination or suspension of the public health emergency. Employees may use public health emergency paid sick leave for the following absences related to a public health emergency:

- To self-isolate and care for oneself when diagnosed with a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency; self-isolate and care for oneself when experiencing symptoms of a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency; seek or obtain medical diagnosis, care or treatment if experiencing symptoms of a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency; seek preventive care concerning a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency;
- To care for a family member who is self-isolating after being diagnosed with a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency; is experiencing symptoms of a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency; needs medical diagnosis, care or treatment if experiencing symptoms of a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency; or is seeking preventive care concerning a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency;
- With respect to a communicable illness that is the cause of a public health emergency:

#### **Chicago/Cook County Paid Leave and Paid Sick Leave**

Gresham Smith provides paid leave and paid sick leave to covered employees in Cook County (including but not limited to the City of Chicago) who work for Gresham Smith at least 80 hours within a 120-day period. This policy does not apply to employees working in areas of Cook County that have "opted-out" of complying with the Cook County Earned Sick Leave Ordinance. To the extent such employees are eligible for paid leave or paid sick leave under the general PTO policy and/or any other applicable sick time/leave law or ordinance, this policy applies solely to the extent it provides greater benefits/rights on any specific issue or issues than the general PTO policy and/or any other applicable sick time/leave law or ordinance.

Employees begin accruing earned paid sick leave on the first day of employment. Employees accrue one (1) hour of paid leave for every 35 hours worked, up to a maximum accrual of 40 hours each year. Employees accrue one (1) hour of paid sick leave for every 35 hours worked, up to a maximum accrual of 40 hours each year. Exempt employees are assumed to work 40 hours in each workweek unless their normal workweek is less than 40 hours, in which case earned paid leave and paid sick leave accrues based upon their normal workweek. For purposes of this policy, the year is the consecutive 12-month period beginning January 1 and ending on December 31.

Paid leave may be used for any reason after 90 days of employment. Gresham Smith reserves the right to deny any request to take paid leave.

Employees may use earned paid sick leave 30 calendar days after the start of employment. Earned paid sick leave must be used in a minimum increment of four (4) hours. Generally, the employee may not use more than 40 hours of earned paid sick leave per year, except that the employee on FMLA leave with earned paid sick leave carried over from the previous year can use an additional 20 hours of earned paid sick leave (for a total of 60 hours of earned paid sick leave) that year.

Earned paid sick leave can be used when:

- The employee is ill or injured or receiving medical care, including preventative care, diagnosis, or treatment, for medical, mental, or behavioral issues, including substance abuse disorders;
- A family member is ill, injured or ordered to quarantine, or to care for a family member receiving professional care, including preventative care, diagnosis, or treatment, for medical, mental, or behavioral issues, including substance abuse disorders;
- A family member needs personal care including to ensure the family member's basic medical, hygiene, nutritional or safety needs are met; to provide transportation to medical appointments if the family member is unable to meet those needs; or to be physically present to provide emotional support for a family member with a serious health condition who is receiving inpatient or home care;
- The employee or a family member is the victim of domestic violence, a sex offense or human trafficking;
- The employee's place of business is closed by order of a public official due to a public health emergency, or the employee needs to care for a family member whose school or place of care has been closed; or
- The employee obeys an order issued by the Mayor of Chicago, the governor of Illinois, the Chicago Department of Public Health or a treating healthcare provider requiring the employee to:
	- o Stay at home to minimize the transmission of a communicable disease;
	- o Remain at home while experiencing symptoms or sick with a communicable disease;
	- o Obey a quarantine order issued to the employee; or
	- o Obey an isolation order issued to the employee.

For purposes of this policy, "family member" means child, spouse or domestic partner, parent, spouse or domestic partner's parent, sibling, grandparent, grandchild or any other individual related by blood or whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship. Adoptive, "step," foster, legal guardianship and in loco-parentis relationships are all included within this definition.

The employee's use of earned paid sick leave will not be conditioned upon searching for or finding a replacement worker. Employees who are absent for a covered reason(s) are generally required to use available earned paid sick leave during the absence.

When the use of earned paid sick leave is reasonably foreseeable (e.g., pre-scheduled healthcare appointments or court dates in a domestic violence case), the employee is required to provide up to seven (7) days' notice to their immediate supervisor before leave is taken. When the use of earned paid sick leave is not reasonably foreseeable, the employee is required to provide notice to their immediate supervisor as soon as is practicable on the day the employee intends to take earned paid sick leave.

For earned paid sick leave absences of more than three (3) consecutive work days, Gresham Smith may require reasonable documentation that the earned paid sick leave was used for a reason covered under this policy. For reason numbers #1 and #2 above, the employee can provide documentation signed by a licensed healthcare provider. For reason number #4 above, the employee can provide a police report; a court document; a signed statement from an attorney, clergy member, or victim services advocate; or any other reasonable documentary evidence, including a written statement from the employee or any other person who has knowledge of the circumstances. Documentation need not explain the nature of the employee's or a family member's health condition or the details of the domestic violence, sex offense or human trafficking.

Earned paid sick leave will be paid at the same rate the employee earns from their employment at the time the employee uses such leave, unless otherwise required by applicable law, and no less than the applicable minimum wage. Use of earned paid sick leave is not considered hours worked for purposes of calculating overtime.

Employees may carry over up to 16 hours of paid leave and up to 80 hours of paid sick leave to the following year.

When employees use earned paid sick leave while on FMLA, the notice and documentation/certification requirements under the FMLA, and any other applicable provisions of the FMLA, take precedence to the extent they conflict with a provision of this policy.

Gresham Smith prohibits retaliation against employees for requesting or using earned paid sick leave or for filing a claim with the Chicago Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection or the Cook County Commission on Human Rights. Employees who believe that their legal rights have been violated are encouraged to contact their immediate supervisor or Human Resources. Employees may make a complaint with the Cook County Commission on Human Rights in person (69 W. Washington, Suite 3040, Chicago, IL 60602), by email (human.rights@cookcountyil.gov), or by telephone (312-603-1100).

#### **Parental Leave Act**

A Maryland employee may be eligible for up to six weeks of parental leave if the employee has been employed by Gresham Smith for at least 12 months and has worked at least 1,250 hours during the last 12 months. Parental leave may be used for the birth of a child or the placement of a child for adoption or foster care. You must use accrued PTO during this period. Leave will be unpaid once accrued leave is exhausted. Employees will continue to be covered by Gresham Smith's health insurance while on parental leave.

If you wish to take leave under this policy, please contact Human Resources.

## **Flexible Leave Act**

Maryland employees are permitted to use accrued PTO to care for an immediate family member who is ill under the same terms, conditions, and policy rules that apply when the employee takes leave for their own illness. This will not extend the maximum amount of leave available under the FMLA. Qualifying leave must be accrued at the time of the request.

#### **Family Military Leave**

Gresham Smith allows eligible employees one day of unpaid leave on the date that a member of the employee's immediate family is being deployed overseas or is returning from an overseas deployment. Immediate family member is defined as a spouse, parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, or sibling. To request leave, you must give advance notice, whenever possible. You may be required to provide documentation of the date of deployment or return to validate that the requested absence is for a qualifying reason.

If you wish to take leave under this policy, please contact Human Resources.

#### **Attendance and Time Off: Voting**

For employees in Maryland, if a period of time beyond 30 minutes to vote is necessary, those employees are entitled to an additional 1.5 hours of paid absence in order to vote in a general or special election in the polls if they do not have two (2) consecutive hours before or after work to vote.

For more information, view the Jury Duty/Other Court Appearances policy in the handbook.

#### **Sick and Safe Leave**

Eligible Maryland employees are entitled to earn "Sick and Safe Leave" ("SSL") at the rate of one hour of leave for every 30 hours that an employee works, up to a maximum of 40 hours of leave per year. The year begins on January 1 and ends on December 31. Employees who are exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act are assumed to work 40 hours per week. If you are an eligible employee, you may carry over up to 40 hours of earned but unused SSL from year to year. However, you may not accrue more than 64 hours of SSL at any time.

Employees will not be paid for any unused SSL on termination of employment. If an employee leaves employment and is rehired within 37 weeks of leaving, any earned and unused SSL that the employee had at the time of separation will be reinstated. Employees are not permitted to use leave during the first 106 calendar days of their employment.

Employees are allowed to use SSL under the following conditions:

- To care for or treat the employee's mental or physical illness, injury, or condition;
- To obtain preventative medical care for the employee or the employee's family member;
- To care for a family member with a mental or physical illness, injury, or condition;
- For maternity or paternity leave; or
- The absence from work is necessary due to domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking committed against the employee or the employee's family member, and the leave is being used:
- To obtain medical or mental health care;
- To obtain services from a victim services organization;
- For legal services or proceedings; or
- Because the employee has temporarily relocated resulting from the domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking.

Employees must use SSL in four (4) hour increments. If the need to use SSL is foreseeable, employees must provide notice seven (7) days in advance. If the need to use SSL is not foreseeable, employees must provide notice as soon as practicable.

A request for SSL may be denied if an employee does not provide the required notice and the employee's absence will cause disruption to the employer.

Employees may only use SSL for authorized reasons. Employees using SSL for unauthorized reasons or who have demonstrated a pattern of abusing SSL may be denied the right to use SSL in the future. Improper use of SSL is prohibited.

If an employee uses SSL for more than two consecutive scheduled shifts, the employee must provide verification that the leave use was appropriate.

It is against Maryland law for Gresham Smith to take adverse action against any employee who lawfully exercises their rights under the Maryland Healthy Working Families Act.

#### **Employment Practices: Pre-employment Screening**

Gresham Smith will not require Maryland applicants to disclose or reveal whether they have a criminal record or otherwise have had criminal accusations brought against them before the first in-person interview. However, Gresham Smith may inquire into a Maryland applicant's criminal history during or after an interview.

Effective Date: 6/23/2025 – Supersedes Date: 9/1/2024

#### **Crime Victim Leave**

Gresham Smith does not discriminate against any employee in Michigan who has an obligation to participate in a judicial proceeding as a witness, because the employee or a close family member was victimized by a criminal act, or because the employee is summoned to appear before a court that is holding a proceeding regarding their children or wards.

You must notify the firm immediately when you are called for a court appearance under this policy, and you must provide a copy of the summons or comparable documentation to your supervisor. Gresham Smith will maintain records of your leave in a confidential manner.

#### **Military Leave**

Gresham Smith believes it is important for its employees to fulfill their civic duties. Employees who enter either active or inactive training duties or service in the armed forces of the state of Michigan or of the United States (including the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, National Guard, Air National Guard, or any of their reserve units) will be granted leave and re-employment rights as required by applicable law.

If you wish to take leave under this policy, please contact Human Resources.

#### **Paid Sick Leave**

Gresham Smith provides paid sick leave to employees who work in Michigan. For employees who work in Michigan who are eligible for sick time under the general PTO policy and/or any other applicable sick time/leave law or ordinance, this policy applies solely to the extent it provides greater benefits/rights on any specific issue or issues than the general PTO policy and/or any other applicable sick time/leave law or ordinance.

Michigan employees accrue one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours worked. Exempt employees are assumed to work 40 hours in each workweek unless their normal workweek is less than 40 hours, in which case paid sick leave accrues based upon that normal workweek. For purposes of this policy, the benefit year is the consecutive 12-month period beginning January 1 and ending on December 31.

Employees may begin using accrued paid sick leave on the 90th calendar day of employment. Paid sick leave may be used in 1/4-hour increments, except to the extent such increment is greater than the number of hours the employee was scheduled to work during that shift. The employee may not use more than 72 hours of paid sick leave in any benefit year.

Employees may use paid sick leave for the following reasons:

- The employee's or the employee's family member's mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of the employee's mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; or preventative medical care for the employee.
- If the employee or the employee's family member is a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault, for medical care or psychological or other counseling for physical or psychological injury or disability; to obtain services from a victim services organization; to relocate due to domestic violence or sexual assault; to obtain legal services; or to participate in any civil or criminal proceedings related to or resulting from the domestic violence or sexual assault.
- For meetings at a child's school or place of care related to the child's health or disability, or the effects of domestic violence or sexual assault on the child; or
- For closure of the employee's place of business by order of a public official due to a public health emergency; for an employee's need to care for a child whose school or place of care has been closed by order of a public official due to a public health emergency; or when it has been determined by the health authorities having jurisdiction or by a health care provider that the employee's or employee's family member's presence in the community would jeopardize the health of others because of the employee's or family member's exposure to a communicable disease.

For the purposes of this policy, a "family member" includes:

- Biological, adopted or foster child, stepchild or legal ward, or a child to whom the employee stands in loco parentis;
- Biological parent, foster parent, stepparent, adoptive parent, or legal guardian of an employee or an employee's spouse or domestic partner or a person who stood in loco parentis when the employee was a minor child;
- Grandparent;
- Grandchild;
- Biological, foster, and adopted sibling; and
- Any other individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship.

When the use of paid sick leave is foreseeable, employees are required to make a reasonable effort to schedule the use of paid sick leave in a manner that does not unduly disrupt the firm's operations. Requests to use paid sick leave may be made orally, in writing or electronically (e.g., via email) and whenever possible, the request must include the expected duration of the employee's absence.

Gresham Smith will require reasonable documentation if the employee uses paid sick leave for three (3) or more consecutive workdays. Misuse of paid sick leave is not permitted.

Paid sick leave will be paid at the same rate of pay with the same benefits as the employee normally earns, but no less than the state minimum wage.

The employee may carry over up to 72 hours of accrued, unused paid sick leave under this policy to the following benefit year. Accrued but unused paid sick leave under this policy will not be paid at separation.

Gresham Smith prohibits retaliation or the threat of retaliation against the employee for exercising or attempting to exercise any right provided in this policy or under applicable law.

## <span id="page-43-0"></span>State Supplement: Minnesota

Effective Date: 1/1/2025

#### **Pregnancy Accommodation**

Gresham Smith will provide eligible Minnesota employees with reasonable accommodations for health conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth. Eligible employees are those who have worked for the firm for at least 12 months prior to the request and who worked an average of at least one-half of a full-time schedule during the 12-month period immediately preceding the request for accommodation.

Eligible employees may request reasonable accommodations, such as temporary transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position; a temporary leave of absence; a modified work schedule or job assignment; seating; more frequent or longer break periods; and limits to heavy lifting. The following reasonable accommodations will be provided upon request and without medical certification: 1) more frequent restroom, food and water breaks; (2) seating; and/or (3) limits on lifting over 20 pounds. For all other requests for reasonable accommodation, an employee must obtain the advice of her licensed health care provider or certified doula, and the request need not be granted if it would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the firm's business

Employees with questions or concerns regarding this policy or who would like to request an accommodation should contact Human Resources. Gresham Smith will not discriminate or retaliate against employees because they request or make use of accommodations in accordance with this policy. This policy does not limit a pregnant employee's rights under any other policy or laws protecting gender, pregnancy, childbirth or health conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth.

#### **Pregnancy and Parenting Leave**

Eligible Minnesota employees will be allowed up to 12 weeks of unpaid pregnancy or parenting leave in accordance with the Minnesota Pregnancy and Parenting Leave Act (MPPLA). Eligible employees are those who have worked for the firm for at least 12 months immediately preceding the request for leave and who worked an average of at least one-half of a full-time schedule during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave.

MPPLA leave is available to biological or adoptive parents in conjunction with the birth or adoption of a child. A "child" is a person under the age of 18 or under the age of 20 but still attending a secondary school. The leave must begin within 12 months of the birth or adoption of the employee's child, or if the child remains in the hospital longer than the mother, within 12 months after the child leaves the hospital.

MPPLA leave is also available to female employees for prenatal care or for incapacity due to pregnancy, childbirth or related health conditions and will begin at a time requested by the employee.

Where both the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and MPPLA apply, the leave provided by each will count against the employee's entitlement under both laws. An employee who is eligible for leave under only one of these laws will receive benefits in accordance with that law only.

The amount of pregnancy or parenting leave will be reduced by any firm-provided paid leave, including disability, personal, medical or sick leave, if applicable, or accrued PTO, so the total leave (pregnancy/parenting plus paid leave) is not more than 12 weeks.

The firm will continue to make insurance coverage under any group insurance policy, group subscriber contract or healthcare plan available to the employee and the employee's dependents on the same basis as if the employee were not on leave. However, during the leave period, employees will be required to pay the full cost of coverage, including any contributions formerly paid by the firm when the employee was not on leave.

Employees must notify Human Resources of the date and duration of the requested leave no later than 30 days before the commencement of the leave. Employees returning from a leave lasting longer than one month must notify their supervisor or Human Resources at least two weeks prior to the anticipated return date.

Upon return, employees will be reinstated to the same position and pay (including any automatic adjustments that occurred during the leave period) or to a position of comparable duties, hours and pay.

Gresham Smith will not retaliate against an employee for requesting or taking a pregnancy or parenting leave of absence in accordance with this policy.

#### **Adoption Leave**

Minnesota employees who are adoptive parents will be permitted to take two weeks of leave for the adoption of a child. Leave may begin before or at the time the child is placed in the home and can be for the purpose of arranging for the child's placement or caring for the child after placement. Benefits and leave rights herein will run concurrently with benefits or leave rights under any other applicable law or policy, where permissible and applicable.

For further information or to request leave under this policy, contact Human Resources.

#### **Sick and Safe Time**

Gresham Smith provides paid sick and safe time to eligible Minnesota employees in compliance with Minnesota's Earned Sick and Safe Time (ESST) law.

The guidelines in this policy do not supersede applicable federal, state, or local laws regarding leaves of absence, including but not limited to leave taken under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA); leave taken as a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); or any other applicable federal, state, or local law, including those prohibiting discrimination and harassment. Where applicable, leave under this policy will run concurrently with all other applicable leaves.

This policy is in lieu of—not in addition to—any accrual, carry over and use of PTO that an employee may receive under the firm Paid Time Off policy because such PTO (a) is accrued in equal or greater increments than those set forth below and (b) may be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions as set forth below.

Employees who accrue sufficient paid time off at the required rates under the Company's main PTO policies will not accrue any additional sick time under this policy but may request and use sick leave, up to the maximum allowed by law, in accordance with the following provisions.

Once the maximum statutory amount of PTO running concurrently as protected sick leave has been exhausted in any given calendar year, the Company's normal policies and procedures will apply to any further use of accrued PTO for any reason.

Employees (including full-time, part-time, and temporary employees) become eligible for paid sick and safe time once they have worked in Minnesota for at least 80 hours in a year. Eligible employees accrue paid sick and safe time on the employee's date of hire as part of their PTO benefits. Paid sick and safe time accrues one hour for every 30 hours worked, up to a maximum of 48 hours per year (i.e., regular and consecutive 12 month period, as determined by the Company), unless the Company agrees to a higher amount.

PTO benefits accrued under the main Paid Time Off policy are used to satisfy the accrual requirements of the ESST. No additional benefits or time will accrue under this policy.

All ESST time used for the purposes outlined below must be coded as such in the firm's timekeeping system for recordkeeping purposes. Once you have used 48 hours of ESST-covered time in any given calendar year, any additional PTO time that you use during that same calendar year will not be covered by this policy or the ESST

Employees may use paid sick and safe time for themselves and their family members:

- For medical diagnosis, care or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or heath condition;
- For preventive medical or health care;
- Due to closure of the employee's place of business due to weather or other public emergency or an employee's need to care for a family member whose school or place of care has been closed due to weather or other public emergency;
- For the employee's inability to work or telework because the employee is: (i) prohibited from working by the employer due to health concerns related to the potential transmission of a communicable illness related to a public emergency; or (ii) seeking or awaiting the results of a diagnostic test for, or a medical diagnosis of, a communicable disease related to a public emergency and such employee has been exposed to a communicable disease or the employee's employer has requested a test or diagnosis; or
- When it has been determined by the health authorities having jurisdiction or by a health care professional that the presence of the employee or family member of the employee in the community would jeopardize the health of others because of the exposure of the employee or family member of the employee to a communicable disease, whether or not the employee or family member has actually contracted the communicable disease.

Employees may also use paid sick and safe time if the employee is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking and time off is needed to:

- Obtain services from a victim services organization;
- Obtain psychological or other counseling;
- Seek relocation or take steps to secure an existing home due to domestic abuse, sexual assault, or stalking; or

- Seek legal advice or take legal action, including preparing for or participating in any civil or criminal legal proceeding related to or resulting from domestic abuse, sexual assault, or stalking.
For purposes of this policy, "eligible family members" include a:

- Spouse;
- Biological, adult or foster child; legal ward; or a child to whom the employee is a legal guardian or who stands in loco parentis;
- Biological, adoptive or foster parent; stepparent or a person who stood in loco parentis when the employee was a minor child;
- Biological, step, or foster sibling;
- Child of the employee's sibling;
- Sibling of the parents of the employee;
- Child-in-law or sibling-in-law;
- Grandparent or step-grandparent;
- Biological, foster, or step-grandchild;
- Registered domestic partner (as defined by state or local law), as well the same family members of the registered domestic partner as listed above for the employee;
- Any other individual related by blood or whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship' and
- Up to one individual annually designated by the employee.

When the need for earned sick and safe time use is foreseeable, employees must provide at least seven (7) days advance notice to their supervisor or Human Resources for any absence from work. If the need for earned sick and safe time is unforeseeable, employees must provide notice to their supervisor or Human Resources of the need to use the time as soon as practicable. An employee who uses more than three (3) consecutive days of earned sick and safe time must provide documentation including a signed statement by a health care professional indicating that the need for use of earned sick and safe time. Pursuant to applicable Minnesota law, employees may provide a written statement prepared by the employee as written documentation when the employee is using earned sick and safe time to care for a family member when the employee or employee's family member did not receive services from a health care professional or if documentation cannot be obtained from a health care professional in a reasonable time or without added expense.

Upon return from leave, employees will be reinstated to the same position and pay (including any automatic adjustments that occurred during the leave period) or to a position of comparable duties, hours and pay. An employee, by agreement with the firm, may return to work part time during the leave period without forfeiting the right to return to employment at the end of the leave

Compensation for accrued and unused sick and safe time is not provided upon separation from employment for any reason, unless otherwise provided for in the main PTO policy. Unless it was paid out upon separation, if an employee is rehired by the firm within 180 days from the date of separation, previously accrued but unused earned sick and safe time will be reinstated.

Gresham Smith will keep confidential the health and medical information of the employee or employee's covered family member, as well as information related to domestic violence perpetrated against or sexual assault of the employee or employee's covered family member. Such information will not be disclosed except to the affected employee or as required by law.

Employees with questions or concerns about this policy or who would like to request leave should contact Human Resources. Gresham Smith will not discriminate or retaliate against employees because they request or take accrued, available leave in accordance with this policy.

#### **Military Leave**

Minnesota employees who are members of the military or naval forces of the United States or Minnesota will be allowed an unpaid military leave of absence when called to active state or federal military service during time of war or emergency.

Gresham Smith will not terminate an employee who is returning from military leave with the United States armed forces, without cause, within one year following the date of reemployment.

#### **Accommodating the Disabled**

As it will for individuals with a disability as defined in the handbook, Gresham Smith will endeavor to reasonably accommodate the needs of an employee's pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding or expressing milk for breastfeeding, or related medical condition, including recovery from childbirth, provided that the pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition is known or should have been known by Gresham Smith, and the proposed accommodation does not impose an undue hardship on the business operations of Gresham Smith's business.

- Periodic rest;
- Assistance with manual labor;
- Job restructuring or modified work schedules;

If you would like to request a reasonable accommodation, please contact your immediate supervisor or Human Resources.

#### **Paid Sick Leave**

Gresham Smith provides paid Earned Sick and Safe Leave ("ESSL") to employees who work in New Jersey. For employees who work in New Jersey who are eligible for sick time under the general PTO policy and/or any other applicable sick time/leave law or ordinance, this policy applies solely to the extent it provides greater benefits/rights on any specific issue or issues than the general Sick Days policy and/or any other applicable sick time/leave law or ordinance.

New Jersey employees accrue one hour of paid leave for every 30 hours worked. Exempt employees are assumed to work 40 hours in each workweek unless their normal workweek is less than 40 hours, in which case ESSL accrues based upon that normal workweek. For purposes of this policy, the benefit year is the consecutive 12-month period beginning January 1 and ending on December 31.

Employees may begin using accrued ESSL on the 120th calendar day of employment. ESSL may be used in 1/4 hour increments, except to the extent such increment is greater than the number of hours the employee was scheduled to work during that shift. The employee may not use more than 40 hours of ESSL in any benefit year.

Employees may use ESSL for the following reasons:

- Diagnosis, care or treatment of, or recovery from, the employee's mental or physical illness, injury or other adverse health condition or for preventive medical care for the employee;
- Diagnosis, care or treatment of, or recovery from, a family member's mental or physical illness, injury or other adverse health condition or for preventive medical care for the family member;
- Circumstances resulting from the employee, or a family member of the employee, being a victim of domestic or sexual violence, if the leave is to allow the employee to obtain for the employee or the family member:
	- o Medical attention needed to recover from physical or psychological injury or disability caused by domestic or sexual violence;
	- o Services from a designated domestic violence agency or other victim services organization;
	- o Psychological or other counseling;
	- o Relocation; or
	- o Legal services, including obtaining a restraining order or preparing for, or participating in, any civil or criminal legal proceeding related to domestic or sexual violence.
- Time during which the employee is not able to work because of:
	- o A closure of the employee's workplace, or the school or place of care of a child of the employee by order of a public official or because of a state of emergency declared by the governor, due to an epidemic or other public health emergency;
	- o The declaration of a state of emergency by the governor, or the issuance by a healthcare provider or the Commissioner of Health or other public health authority of a determination that the presence in the community of the employee, or a member of the employee's family in need of care by the employee would jeopardize the health of others;
	- o During a state of emergency declared by the governor, or upon the recommendation, direction or order of a healthcare provider or the Commissioner of Health or other authorized public official, the employee undergoes isolation or quarantine or cares for a family member in quarantine as a result of suspected exposure to a communicable disease and a finding by the provider or authority that the presence in the community of the employee or family member would jeopardize the health of others.
- Time needed by the employee in connection with a child of the employee to attend a school-related conference, meeting, function or other event requested or required by a school administrator, teacher or other professional staff member responsible for the child's education; or to attend a meeting regarding care provided to the child in connection with the child's health conditions or disability.

For purposes of this policy, a family member includes a child, grandchild, sibling, spouse, domestic partner, civil union partner, parent or grandparent of the employee; or a spouse, domestic partner, or civil union partner of a parent or grandparent of the employee; or a sibling of a spouse, domestic partner or civil union partner of the employee; or any other individual related by blood to the employee or whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship.

Unless the employee advises Gresham Smith otherwise, we will assume, subject to applicable law, that employees want to use available ESSL for absences for reasons set forth above and employees will be paid for such absences to the extent they have ESSL available.

If the employee's need to use ESSL is foreseeable, employees must give seven (7) calendar days advance notice, prior to the date the leave is to begin, of their intention to use the leave and its expected duration. If the reason for the leave is not foreseeable, employees must give notice of the intention to use ESSL as soon as practicable. Gresham Smith may prohibit employees from using foreseeable ESSL on certain dates or require reasonable documentation if ESSL that is not foreseeable is used during such dates.

Gresham Smith will require reasonable documentation if the employee uses ESSL for three (3) or more consecutive work days. If ESSL is taken for reasons #1 or #2 above, documentation signed by a healthcare professional, who is treating the employee or the family member of the employee, indicating the need for the leave and, if possible, number of days of leave, will be considered reasonable documentation. If ESSL is taken for reason #3 above, any of the following will be considered reasonable documentation of the domestic or sexual violence:

- Medical documentation;
- A law enforcement agency record or report;
- A court order;
- Documentation that the perpetrator of the domestic or sexual violence has been convicted of a domestic or sexual violence offense;
- Certification from a certified Domestic Violence Specialist or a representative of a designated domestic violence agency or other victim services organization; or
- Other documentation or certification provided by a social worker, counselor, member of the clergy, shelter worker, healthcare professional, attorney or other professional who has assisted the employee or family member in dealing with the domestic or sexual violence.

If ESSL is taken for reason #4 above, a copy of the order of the public official or the determination by the health authority will be considered reasonable documentation. If ESSL is taken for reason #5 above, the following will be considered reasonable documentation: tangible proof of the school-related conference, meeting, function or other event requested or required by a school administrator, teacher or other professional staff member responsible for the education of the employee's child; or tangible proof of the meeting regarding care provided to the child of the employee in connection with the child's health conditions or disability.

ESSL will be paid at the same rate of pay with the same benefits as the employee normally earns, but no less than the state minimum wage. Use of ESSL will not be counted as hours worked for purposes of calculating overtime.

The employee may carry over up to 40 hours of accrued, unused ESSL under this policy to the following benefit year. Accrued but unused ESSL under this policy will not be paid at separation.

Employees have the right to request and use ESSL and may file a complaint for alleged violations of their rights with the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development. Gresham Smith prohibits retaliation or the threat of retaliation against the employee for exercising or attempting to exercise any right provided in this policy or under applicable law.

New Jersey employees unable to work because of a non-work-related accident or illness for a period in excess of seven days may be eligible for New Jersey State Temporary Disability Benefits (TDB) for a maximum period set forth in New Jersey law, usually 26 weeks.

#### **Unpaid Sick Leave**

Gresham Smith provides Oregon employees with unpaid sick leave in accordance with Oregon law.

The guidelines in this policy do not supersede applicable federal, state, or local laws regarding leaves of absence, including but not limited to leave taken under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), leave taken as a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), or any other applicable federal, state, or local law, including those prohibiting discrimination and harassment. Where applicable, leave under this policy will run concurrently with all other applicable leaves. This policy is in lieu of – not in addition to – any accrual, carry over and use of PTO that an employee may receive under the firm's main PTO policy because such PTO (a) is accrued in equal or greater increments than those set forth below and (b) may be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions as set forth below. Employees who accrue sufficient paid time off at the required rates under the firm's main PTO policies will not accrue any additional sick time under this policy, but may request and use sick leave, up to the maximum allowed by law, in accordance with the following provisions. Once the maximum statutory amount of PTO running concurrently as protected sick leave has been exhausted in any given calendar year, the firm's normal policies and procedures will apply to any further use of accrued PTO for any reason.

All employees are eligible to earn unpaid protected sick leave up to a maximum of 40 hours of leave per year. You can earn unpaid sick leave at a rate of one hour for every 30 hours worked, or alternatively, at a rate of one and one-third hours of leave for every 40 hours worked.

Oregon employees may only use a total of 40 hours of sick leave in any calendar year. Additionally, you can carry over a maximum of 40 hours of accrued but unused protected sick leave to the following calendar year. Employees begin to accrue sick leave immediately upon hire, but you may only use sick leave after you have been employed for at least 90 days.

Employees may carry over up to 40 hours of protected sick time from one calendar year to the next. However, Gresham Smith has adopted a policy that limits employees to:

- Accruing no more than 80 hours of sick time in one calendar year.
- Using no more than 40 hours of sick time in one calendar year.

Protected sick leave can be used as needed:

- For your own illness, injury, or health condition, including time off for medical diagnosis, care, treatment, and preventive care.
- To care for a family member with an illness, injury, or health condition, including time off for medical diagnosis, care, treatment, and preventive care ("family member" has the same definition as under the Oregon Family Leave Act (OFLA)).
- For any purposes allowed under the OFLA, such as bereavement leave, caring for a newborn child or newly adopted/foster child, or sick child leave.
- For any purpose allowed under Oregon's domestic violence, harassment, sexual assault, or stalking law.
- In the event of a public health emergency, including upon an order of a general or specific public health emergency, or when the employer excludes the employee from the workplace by law or rule for health reasons.

Unpaid sick leave may be used for qualifying absences for scheduled workdays and hours only, in increments as small as one hour. Unpaid sick leave may be used to cover all or part of a shift, depending on how long you are gone from work. Any leave used for vacation or holiday purposes should be taken in full-day increments.

For planned unpaid sick leave, including but not limited to medical appointments, you must notify your supervisor at least 10 days before the date the leave will commence or as soon as practicable. You must make reasonable efforts to schedule planned unpaid sick leave in a manner that does not unduly disrupt operations and should attempt not to schedule unpaid sick leave during peak work hours, when work is time-sensitive, or when mandatory meetings are scheduled.

When unpaid sick leave is unforeseeable, you must notify your supervisor before the start of the scheduled work shift, or as soon as practicable.

No employee will suffer discrimination or retaliation for requesting, using, or complaining that they are not receiving unpaid sick leave as required by Oregon law. While Gresham Smith encourages employees to bring any concerns or complaints about compliance with the Oregon unpaid sick leave law to the attention of Human Resources, the law requires employers to advise employees that they may file a complaint with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries if they are denied unpaid sick leave or are retaliated against for requesting or taking unpaid sick leave.

#### **Paid Family Medical Leave**

Paid Family Medical Leave (also known as Paid Leave Oregon or "PLO") is a statewide insurance program available to eligible Oregon employees that provides paid time off to give or receive care for Qualifying Events as defined by the PLO law. The program is funded by premiums paid by employees and employers, and it is administered by the Oregon Employment Department (OED). Employers collect the premiums and send them to the OED.

To qualify, employees must:

- Work in Oregon;
- Have earned $1000 in wages in either the year benefits are requested, or the year prior;
- Have contributed to PLO in either the year benefits are requested, or the year prior;
- Have experienced a Qualifying Event.

If you qualify, this program will allow you to take up to 12 weeks of paid leave, as needed, for Qualifying Events. Qualifying Events include:

- Birth.
- Adoption.
- Foster care placement.
- Employee's own serious health condition.
- Caring for family member with serious health condition.
- Certain purposes related to employee or employee's minor child or dependent experiencing domestic violence, harassment, sexual assault, bias, or stalking.
- Effectuating the legal process for foster care placement or adoption.

If you are pregnant, have given birth, or experience health issues or limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition, you may be eligible to take an additional two weeks of leave, for a total of 14 weeks.

While on PLO, you are entitled to wage replacement. That means you will receive all, or a portion of, your average weekly pay from the OED. To learn more or to acquire an estimate of your weekly benefits, visit: https://paidleave.oregon.gov/employees/benefits-calculator.

You are entitled to use any accrued paid sick leave, accrued vacation leave, or any other paid leave offered by Gresham Smith alongside PLO to replace your wages up to 100% of your average weekly wage. If more than one type of paid leave is available to you, Gresham Smith may choose which type of paid leave must be used first.

PLO may not be used concurrently with workers' compensation time loss benefits or unemployment benefits.

The OED determines your eligibility and qualification for this leave. To apply for benefits, you must submit an application to the OED. However, you should give as much notice to Gresham Smith as possible. Failure to provide adequate notice may result in the OED reducing your benefit amount.

If your need for leave is foreseeable, you must provide Gresham Smtih with written notice at least 30 days before your first day of leave. If the need for leave is unforeseeable, you must provide Gresham Smith with oral notice within 24 hours of commencement of leave, and written notice within three days of commencement of leave. Employees should contact Human Resources to request PLO or for any other questions regarding this paid benefit.

Gresham Smith prohibits employees from being retaliated or discriminated against for exercising their rights to PLO.

#### **Lactation Accommodation**

In accordance with Oregon law, Gresham Smith will provide reasonable breaks, and a private place, for an Oregon employee to express breast milk for the employee's nursing child, as needed, for up to 18 months after the child's birth. If possible, this break time will run concurrently with any break time already provided. For purposes of expressing breast milk, Gresham Smith will make reasonable efforts to provide a suitable room or other location with privacy, other than a toilet stall, in close proximity to the work area.

#### **Military Leave**

Gresham Smith provides Oregon employees unpaid leave to participate in active duty in the state organized militia, any branch of the United States Armed Forces, or the National Guard, and will re-employ workers called up for military duty.

Additionally, Gresham Smith will not discriminate against any Pennsylvania employee who has been injured in the line of duty as a volunteer firefighter, fire police officer, or member of a volunteer ambulance service or rescue squad or who has received workers' compensation benefits as a result of such an injury.

# <span id="page-64-0"></span>State Supplement: Rhode Island

Effective Date: 06/23/2025 – Supersedes Date: 9/1/2024

## **Paid Time Off (PTO)**

For Rhode Island employees separated from employment with Gresham Smith after at least one year of service, any PTO accrued or awarded under Gresham Smith's PTO policy is payable on a prorated basis upon separation.

#### **Paid Sick Leave**

Gresham Smith provides paid Earned Sick and Safe Leave ("ESSL") to employees who work in Rhode Island. For employees who work in Rhode Island who are eligible for sick time under the general PTO policy and/or any other applicable sick time/leave law or ordinance, this policy applies solely to the extent it provides greater benefits/rights on any specific issue or issues than the general PTO policy and/or any other applicable sick time/leave law or ordinance.

Rhode Island employees accrue one hour of paid leave for every 35 hours worked. Exempt employees are assumed to work 40 hours in each workweek unless their normal workweek is less than 40 hours, in which case ESSL accrues based upon that normal workweek. For purposes of this policy, the benefit year is the consecutive 12-month period beginning January 1 and ending on December 31.

Employees may begin using accrued ESSL on the 90th calendar day of employment. ESSL may be used in a minimum increment of four (4) hours per day, except to the extent such increment is greater than the number of hours the employee was scheduled to work during that shift. The employee may not use more than 40 hours of ESSL in any benefit year.

Employees may use ESSL for the following reasons:

- Diagnosis, care or treatment of, or recovery from, the employee's mental or physical illness, injury or other adverse health condition or for preventive medical care for the employee;
- Diagnosis, care or treatment of, or recovery from, a family member's mental or physical illness, injury or other adverse health condition or for preventive medical care for the family member;
- Closure of employees place of business by order of a public official due to a public health emergency or the employees need to care for a child whose school or place of care has been closed by order of a public official due to a public health emergency; or care for oneself or a family member when it has been determined by the health authorities having jurisdiction or by a healthcare provider that the employee's or family member's presence in the community may jeopardize the health of others because of their exposure to a communicable disease, whether or not the employee or family member has actually contracted the communicable disease; or
- Time off needed when the employee or a member of the employee's family is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking.

When the use of ESSL is foreseeable, employees are required to make a reasonable effort to schedule the use of ESSL in a manner that does not unduly disrupt the firm's operations. Requests to use ESSL may be made orally, in writing or electronically (e.g., via email) and whenever possible, the request must include the expected duration of the employee's absence. When the use of ESSL is foreseeable, the employee is required to make a good faith effort to provide notice of the need for such time to their supervisor in

advance of the use of ESSL. When the use of ESSL is not foreseeable, the employee is required to provide notice to their supervisor at least one (1) hour prior to the start of the employee's workday or as soon as possible under the circumstances.

Gresham Smith will require reasonable documentation if the employee uses ESSL for three (3) or more consecutive workdays. Misuse of ESSL is not permitted.

ESSL will be paid at the same rate of pay with the same benefits as the employee normally earns, but no less than the state minimum wage. Use of ESSL will not be counted as hours worked for purposes of calculating overtime.

Accrued but unused ESSL under this policy will not be carried over to the following 12-month period and it will not be paid at separation.

Employees have the right to request and use ESSL and may file a complaint for alleged violations of their rights with the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training. Gresham Smith prohibits retaliation or the threat of retaliation against the employee for exercising or attempting to exercise any right provided in this policy or under applicable law.

#### **Temporary Disability Benefits**

Gresham Smith offers Rhode Island employees short-term disability insurance. This is solely a monetary benefit and not a leave of absence. Employees who will be out of work must also request leave.

#### **Military Family Leave**

Rhode Island employees may take up to 15 days of unpaid leave if the military service member is on leave from deployment, before and up to deployment or during a period of military conflict if they have met all of the following requirements:

- Have a spouse or state-registered domestic partner in military service.
- Have been employed by Gresham Smith for at least one year.
- Worked at least 1,250 hours of service within the last 12 months.
- Employees must inform their immediate supervisor with notice of your intent to take leave with at least 14 days' notice of the intended start date for taking leave, if the leave will be five or more consecutive work days long.
- As soon as is practicable, if the leave will be for fewer than five consecutive work days.

If you wish to take leave under this policy, please contact Human Resources.

#### **Military Leave**

Eligible Rhode Island employees who are members of state or federal military services (including National and State Guard) shall be entitled to military leave of absence for defense, training, or other service.

If you wish to take leave under this policy, please contact Human Resources.

#### **Paid Temporary Caregiver Benefits**

Rhode Island employees may be eligible for up to seven (7) weeks (increasing to eight (8) weeks on January 1, 2026) of caregiver leave and temporary caregiver benefits within any 52-week period to care for a seriously ill child, spouse, domestic partner, parent, parent-in-law, or grandparent or to bond with a newborn child or child newly placed for adoption or foster care.

Temporary caregiver benefits are available through the Rhode Island "Temporary Caregiver Insurance" (TCI) program, which is administered by the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training (DLT). Temporary caregiver benefits only are available to the employees exercising their right to take a leave while covered by the TCI program. These benefits are financed solely through employee contributions to the TCI program. That program is solely responsible for determining if the employee is eligible for such benefits.

Employees may be eligible for temporary caregiver benefits for any week in which they are unable to perform their regular and customary work because they are:

- 1. Bonding with a newborn child or a child newly placed for adoption or foster care with the employee or domestic partner (available during the first 12 months of parenting only); or
- 2. Caring for a child, a parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, spouse, or domestic partner, who has a serious health condition, subject to a waiting period.

Employees may use accrued paid time during any eligibility waiting period in accordance with Gresham Smith's paid time off policies.

Employees must file a written notice with Gresham Smith with a minimum of 30 days' notice prior to the commencement of the caregiver leave. Failure by the employee to provide the written notice may result in delay or reduction in the claimant's benefits, except in the event the time of the leave is unforeseeable or the time of the leave changes for unforeseeable circumstances.

Individuals who exercise their rights to leave covered by the TCI program must file a certificate form with the DLT containing all information required by the DLT.

Any employees who exercise their rights to leave covered by TCI will, upon the expiration of that leave, be entitled to be restored by Gresham Smith to the position held when the leave commenced, or to a position with equivalent seniority, status, employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment including fringe benefits and service credits that the employee had been entitled to at the commencement of leave.

During any caregiver leave taken pursuant to this policy, Gresham Smith will maintain any existing health benefits in force for the duration of the leave as if the employee had continued in employment continuously from the date the leave commenced until the date the caregiver benefits terminate; provided, however, that the employee shall continue to pay any employee shares of the cost of health benefits as required prior to the commencement of the caregiver benefits.

Gresham Smith may require employees who are entitled to leave under the Family & Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and/or the Rhode Island Family Leave Act (RIFLA), who exercise their rights to benefits under the temporary caregiver insurance program, to take any temporary caregiver benefits received, concurrently, with any leave taken pursuant to the FMLA and/or RIFLA.

Employees should consult Human Resources with questions regarding this policy.

#### **Employment Practices: Pre-employment Screening**

Gresham Smith will not exclude a Rhode Island applicant from an initial interview solely because of a past criminal conviction by requiring an applicant to disclose a criminal conviction:

- On an employment application;
- Before an interview; or
- If no interview is conducted, before a conditional offer of employment.

However, Gresham Smith may, before extending an offer to an applicant, inquire into the applicant's criminal history.

For more information, view the Pre-employment Screening Policy in the handbook.

You must apply for your former position in writing within five days of honorable discharge from duty or release from hospitalization following duty.

If you are still qualified for your previous position, you will be placed in your previous position or a position of like seniority, status, and salary, unless Gresham Smith's circumstances now make reinstatement unreasonable. If you are no longer qualified for your previous position, you will be placed in a position of appropriate seniority, status, and salary for which you are qualified, unless Gresham Smith's circumstances now make the placement unreasonable.

## <span id="page-70-0"></span>State Supplement: Tennessee

#### **Accommodating the Disabled**

In compliance with the Tennessee Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, as it will for individuals with a disability as defined in the handbook, Gresham Smith will endeavor to provide reasonable accommodations for medical needs arising from pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions, unless the accommodation would pose an undue hardship on the business.

Gresham Smith will not take adverse action against the employee in the terms, conditions or privileges of employment for requesting or using a reasonable accommodation to the known limitations for medical needs arising from pregnancy, childbirth or related conditions, including, but not limited to, counting an absence related to pregnancy under the attendance policy. Gresham Smith will not require employees to take leave if another reasonable accommodation can be provided to the known limitations for medical needs arising from pregnancy, childbirth or related conditions.

Reasonable accommodations may include, but are not limited to:

- Making existing facilities readily accessible to, and usable by, such employees, including acquiring or modifying equipment or devices necessary for performing essential job functions;
- Providing more frequent or longer break periods;
- Providing more frequent bathroom breaks;
- Providing a private place, other than a bathroom stall for the purpose of expressing milk;

Gresham Smith reserves the right, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, to request medical certification from a healthcare professional if an individual is requesting a reasonable accommodation related to temporary transfer to a vacant position, job restructuring, light duty or accommodations that require time away from work. Gresham Smith will engage in an interactive process with the individual to determine if a reasonable accommodation can be provided, absent undue hardship, while the individual is making a good faith effort to obtain the medical certification. Gresham Smith will not take adverse action against the employee related to their need for accommodation while they are engaging in good faith efforts to obtain medical certification.

If you would like to request a reasonable accommodation, please contact your immediate supervisor or Human Resources.

#### **Attendance and Time Off: Paid Parental Leave**

In addition to Gresham Smith's Paid Parental Leave policy, full-time Tennessee employees with at least 12 consecutive months of service as a full-time employee are entitled to unpaid Parental Leave of up to four (4) months in the event of pregnancy, childbirth, nursing the infant and adoption in accordance with Tennessee Code section 4-21-408. With respect to adoptions, the leave period begins when the employee receives custody.

In order to qualify for Parental Leave, advance notice to Gresham Smith generally is required. Gresham Smith must be notified of: the anticipated date of departure for leave, the length of the leave and the intended date of return to full-time employment. Employees who provide three (3) months' notice will be reinstated to the same or similar position after returning from leave. Employees also are eligible for reinstatement and do not forfeit their rights and benefits if they are prevented from giving three (3) months' notice due to a medical emergency or because they received notice of the adoption fewer than three (3) months in advance. In these situations, employees should provide as much advance notice as possible.

If the employee's job is so unique that Gresham Smith cannot, after reasonable efforts, fill that position temporarily, then reinstatement is not guaranteed and the employee will be notified.

Leave runs concurrently with any other leave provided by Gresham Smith to the extent permitted by applicable law. Employees may substitute accrued PTO for the unpaid Parental Leave, but this substitution does not extend the length of the leave.

If you wish to take leave under this policy, please contact Human Resources.

If employees are not entitled to any PTO or have exhausted available PTO, they may be permitted to take unpaid leave. Employees are entitled to the same leave if they are an active volunteer firefighter and they worked for more than four hours as a volunteer firefighter in an emergency in the last day.

Gresham Smith may require you to submit a written statement from the chief of the volunteer fire department:

For purposes of this policy, "family member" means a child (including step-child, adopted child, foster child, or child to whom you stand in loco parentis, is a legal guardian, or is a de facto guardian), grandchild, grandparent, parent (including parent-in-law, adoptive, de facto, or foster parent, step-parent, or legal guardian), sibling, or spouse of an employee, and also includes any individual who regularly resides in the employee's home or where the relationship creates an expectation that the employee care for the person, and that individual depends on the employee for care. "Family member" includes any individual who regularly resides in the employee's home, except that it does not include an individual who simply resides in the same home with no expectation that the employee care for the individual.

Unless advised otherwise, Gresham Smith will assume, subject to applicable law, that employees want to use available paid sick leave for reasons set forth above. Employees will be paid for such absences to the extent they have paid sick leave available.

Paid sick leave may be requested orally, in writing, electronically or by any other means acceptable to Gresham Smith. When possible, employees should include the expected duration of the absence. If the need is foreseeable employees must provide reasonable advance notice to their immediate supervisor of the need to use accrued paid sick leave, and also make a reasonable effort to schedule the paid sick leave in a manner that does not unduly disrupt operations. Where the need is not foreseeable, employees should provide notice as early as practicable.

Gresham Smith cannot retaliate against employees for requesting or using paid sick leave and employees have the right to file a complaint with the Division of Labor Standards and Statistics in the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment or bring a civil action if paid sick leave is denied by Gresham Smith or Gresham Smith retaliates against employees for exercising their rights under applicable law.

#### **Paid Family and Medical Leave**

Eligible Washington employees are entitled to apply for Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML) benefits through the PFML program administered by the Washington Employment Security Department (ESD).

To be eligible for PFML benefits, you must have worked in Washington for at least 820 hours in either the last four completed calendar quarters or four of the last five completed calendar quarters. An eligible employee may receive PFML benefits for the following amounts of time within a one-year period:

- Family Leave. Up to 12 weeks of leave to:
	- o Bond with the employee's newborn child, newly-adopted child, or newly-placed foster child within the 12 months following the birth, adoption, or placement of the child;
	- o Care for a family member with a serious health condition; or
	- o Prepare for a family member's pre- and post-deployment activities, as well as time for childcare issues related to a family member's military deployment.
- Medical Leave. Up to 12 weeks for the employee's own serious health condition.
- Combined Family and Medical Leave. Up to 16 weeks of leave for a combination of Medical Leave and Family Leave (with up to an additional two weeks of leave if you experience a pregnancy-related disability).

For purposes of PFML, a family member is defined as your child (including step-child, adopted child, foster child, or child to whom you stand in loco parentis, is a legal guardian, or is a de facto guardian), grandchild, grandparent, parent (including parent-in-law, adoptive, de facto, or foster parent, step-parent, or legal guardian), sibling, spouse, or registered domestic partner.

While on PFML leave, you will be entitled to partial wage replacement, receiving a portion of their average weekly pay, up to a maximum of $1,000 per week. If you desire to take PFML leave must apply to the Washington Employment Security Department ("ESD"), which pays the benefits. Please visit www.paidleave.wa.gov for more information on applying for PFML benefits.

Employees may, but are not required to, use accrued PTO supplement their PFML benefits during PFML leave.

The PFML program is funded by premiums paid by both employees and employers and is administered by the Washington ESD. A withholding of a small percentage of employees' wages is deducted from

employees' paychecks to cover the employees' portion of the premiums and is submitted quarterly to the Washington ESD.

Employees who return from PFML leave will be restored to the same or an equivalent job if the employee has worked for Gresham Smith for at least 12 months and has worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months before taking leave. Employees should consult with the Human Resources regarding whether their health insurance will continue during leave.

Gresham Smith will not discrimination or retaliate against employees for requesting or taking PFML.

Medical leave, state family and medical leave, disability, or other leave taken for a condition that also qualifies as a serious health condition under the FMLA will be designated as FMLA leave, except where state law requires otherwise. Specifically, a female employee who is unable to work due to childbirth or pregnancy may take pregnancy disability leave in addition to any FMLA leave or PFML for which she is eligible.

If you exhaust your FMLA leave after taking military caregiver leave, you are still entitled to family and medical leave under PFML.

Certain employees who are ineligible for FMLA leave may nevertheless be eligible for PFML benefits paid by the Washington ESD. However, an employee who is ineligible for FMLA will generally not be entitled to reinstatement of employment after their PFML leave. Please contact Human Resources for additional information about PFML.

#### **Domestic Violence Leave**

Washington employees who are victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking may take reasonable unpaid leave from work to take care of legal or law enforcement needs or to get medical treatment, social services assistance, or mental health counseling. Washington employees who are qualifying family members of a domestic violence victim are also eligible for leave under this policy. Although leave is unpaid, employees may substitute their accrued PTO for unpaid leave under this policy. Employees must give as much advance notice of the need for leave under this policy as is possible. Leave requests must be supported by one or more of the following:

- A police report indicating the employee or the employee's family member was a victim.
- A court order providing protection to the victim.
- Documentation from a health care provider, advocate, clergy-member, or attorney.
- A written statement that the employee or the employees family member is a victim and needs assistance.
